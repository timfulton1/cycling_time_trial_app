### Background

I developed this app to improve the accuracy and efficiency of analyzing irregular time series data acquired from a Velotron cycle ergometer. 


### Usage

Upload the raw data from the Velotron using the browse button and choose the bin distance. Average Power for each bin distance is calculated and displayed in the plot and in the table, where it can also be downloaded.
